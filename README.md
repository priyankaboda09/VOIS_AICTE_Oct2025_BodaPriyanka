# Airbnb Hotel Booking Analysis - VOIS AICTE Project

## Problem Statement
Airbnb has transformed urban tourism, but in major cities, some neighborhoods are overcrowded with listings while others remain underutilized.  
This creates issues like **pricing imbalance, inconsistent availability, and uneven guest experiences**.  

Our goal is to analyze Airbnb data and highlight patterns in listings, hosts, and reviews.

## Project Description
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Airbnb Open Data.  

**Key Objectives:**
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.  
- Analyze distribution of listings by neighborhood group.  
- Identify top hosts and their listing counts.  
- Compare review activity and availability across neighborhoods & room types.  
- Create meaningful visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, word clouds, etc.).

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- WordCloud  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- GitHub for hosting

The results here include multiple insights derived from the Airbnb dataset:

- **Listings by Neighborhood Group** → Shows that Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate the Airbnb market, while Staten Island has very few listings.  
- **Top 10 Hosts** → Reveals that a small number of hosts manage a very large number of listings, showing market concentration.  
- **Heatmap of Reviews** → Highlights how guest review activity and satisfaction vary across neighborhoods and room types.  
- **Price Distribution** → Most listings are affordable (under $200), with a few high-end luxury properties skewing the scale.  
- **Room Type Analysis** → Entire homes/apartments are the most common and also more expensive, while shared rooms are rare and cheaper.  
- **Availability Trends** → Many listings are either available all year (365 days) or not available at all (0 days).  
- **Geographical Distribution (Map Scatterplot)** → Manhattan and Brooklyn appear as dense clusters of listings.  
- **Correlation Heatmap** → Shows weak correlation between price and reviews, but stronger link between reviews per month and number of reviews.  
- **Word Cloud of Listing Names** → Common listing keywords include “Cozy”, “Private”, and “Apartment”, reflecting how hosts market their properties.  

Overall, these analyses provide a **clear picture of overcrowding in certain neighborhoods, the dominance of specific hosts, and guest activity patterns**, which can help both hosts and Airbnb management make better decisions.
